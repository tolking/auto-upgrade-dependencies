# Upgrade Dependencies

> Automatically detect and upgrade dependencies when lock files change

When working in a team, you may encounter issues with different dependency versions.

For example, if a team member updates dependencies and commits code, you might not realize that you need to update your dependencies, leading to code execution errors.

Upgrade Dependencies helps you automatically detect changes in dependency versions and prompts you to upgrade them.

## Features

- Automatically detects changes in lock files and prompts for dependency upgrades when changes occur
- Adds buttons for manual update and upgrade of dependencies in the top right corner of the package.json page
